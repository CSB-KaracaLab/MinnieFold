A computationally âš¡ **efficient** âš¡ and ðŸŒ± **green** ðŸŒ± alternative for antibody-antigen complex modeling.
**MinnieFold** significantly reduces GPU hours while maintaining model accuracy, making it an accessible and sustainable solution for protein complex prediction.

Inspired by Wallner's AFsample approach and Raouraoua et al., MassiveFold.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Background

MinnieFold was developed and tested during the CAPRI 55 competition, where it successfully modeled antibody-antigen complexes with reduced computational costs. Key findings and methodologies are detailed in our publication:

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (e.g., Bash, required system tools).
2. Install [Local ColabFold](https://github.com/YoshitakaMo/localcolabfold).
3. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CSB-KaracaLab/MinnieFold.git
   cd MinnieFold/
    ```

### Running MinnieFold
**Set up your scenarios as you wish**: Ensure that each scenario script (s1.sh, s2.sh, ..) is located in the scenarios directory.

**Execute the MinnieFold scrip**t: Use the minniefold-sequential.sh script to run all scenarios sequentially for a given job name. Replace <JobName> with a name of your fasta (without extension) to organize results.
```bash
cd example/
 ./minniefold-sequential.sh <JobName>
```
**What the script does**: 
- Runs all scenarios sequentially.
- Creates a directory structure under results/ to store output files for each scenario.
- Saves log file of each scenario in the corresponding subdirectory (e.g., results/<JobName>/s1/s1.log).

**Example usage**: To run MinnieFold for trial.fasta located under input directory:
```bash
 ./minniefold-sequential.sh trial
```
